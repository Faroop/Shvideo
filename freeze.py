# Syntax to build redistributable package:  python3 freeze.py build
#
# Troubleshooting: If you encounter an error while attempting to freeze
# the PyQt5/uic/port_v2, remove the __init__.py in that folder. And if
# you are manually compiling PyQt5 on Windows, remove the -strip line
# from the Makefile. On Mac, just delete the port_v2 folder. Also, you
# might need to remove the QtTest.so from /usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages/PyQt5,
# if you get errors while freezing.
#
# Mac Syntax to Build App Bundle:
# 1) python3 freeze.py bdist_mac --qt-menu-nib="/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.4.2/plugins/platforms/" --iconfile=installer/shvideo.icns --custom-info-plist=installer/Info.plist --bundle-name="Shvideo Video Editor"
# 2) change Contents/Info.plist to use launch-mac.sh as the Executable name
# 3) manually fix rsvg executable:
#    sudo dylibbundler -od -of -b -x ~/apps/rsvg/rsvg-convert -d ./rsvg-libs/ -p @executable_path/rsvg-libs/
# 4) Code sign and create the DMG (disk image)
#    a) cd ~/apps/shvideo-qt-git/
#    b) bash installer/build-mac-dmg.sh
#
# Windows Syntax to Build MSI Installer
# NOTE: Python3.5 requires custom build of cx_Freeze (https://github.com/sekrause/cx_Freeze-wheels). Download, python setup.py build, python setup.py install
# 1) python3 freeze.py bdist_msi
# NOTE: Requires a tweak to cx_freeze: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24195311/how-to-set-shortcut-working-directory-in-cx-freeze-msi-bundle
# 2) Sign MSI with private code signing key (optional)
#  NOTE: Install Windows 10 SDK first
#  signtool sign /v /f OSStudiosSPC.pfx "shvideo Video Editor-2.0.0-win32.msi"
